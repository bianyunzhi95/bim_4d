    <p>Successful construction management (CM) is sometimes measured by the ability of a management team to complete a percentage of planned work to align with the project schedule. Project success can be measured upon the ability to classify, coordinate and intuitively manage three constraints known as “the iron triangle”, which includes time, cost and quality. Each one of these constraints having a direct influence on the other two constraints and the successful outcome of a project. Waste associated to each of the constraints can have an impact on a project, this can be wasted working hours, material waste or energy waste. Construction projects are similar in that they all use and adapt stage planning procedures but each project is unique with its own set of problems and solutions. An organisation may have an archive of documented projects that will provide information to achieve timely solutions to similar issues, this information needs to be accessible and verifiable, which means an accurate and reliable means of storing and maintaining previous mistakes made and the lessons learnt. A strategy to reduce the risk involved with successful CM and provide a sustainable product that offers greater value may be achieved within a methodical and systematic approach, which promotes a collaborative environment through each stage of a project’s lifecycle.</p>

    <p>4D BIM is the integration of a 3D information model and the temporal completion schedule of a project. Effective planning for a 4D BIM project in alignment with relevant industry standards can provide assurances to stakeholders that the use of 4D BIM enables a construction project with the ability to be completed through a collaborative network of project stakeholders. The collaboration process is an integral part of a BIM project, which requires informed decisions based on the employers information requirements (EIR).</p>
    <p>The EIR states a need for scheduled data exchanges and required 4D models from each architectural, engineering and construction (AEC) discipline. Clash detection of a discipline(s) specific 4D BIM models are merged together to update the reference file, along with review mark-ups, (such as tags, viewpoints and/or comments) which are updated in a sequential process as stipulated in the EIR to correspond with the design changes that are made.</p>
    <br>
    <p>This facilitates a means of sub-contractor discussions to alleviate clashes of model elements before the construction stage of a 4D BIM project. A general understanding is that successful CM requires meticulous “front-end planning” to calculate the project duration from, which planned is compared against actual productivity throughout the construction of the project. The planning process can provide a project with the ability to verify project objectives, assess possible risk factors and provide required solutions. 4D BIM is considered a powerful tool when used in CM planning, which presents the virtual construction (VC) of a federated model that incorporates each AEC discipline’s 4D BIM model, linked to the project schedule and are further defined by linking model elements to time specific tasks. The adoption of BIM and 4D BIM within the construction process provides an effective means of collaboration to all stakeholders, to communicate planned work, design element clashes and design alternatives, which are visualised through a 4D BIM simulation of planned workflows. Although arguments can be made, that the threat to the widespread use of 4D BIM is hindered by the shortage of expert knowledge on the use of the technology and the strategic methods of analysing data from the 4D model put in place to enable optimum efficiency throughout the CM process, which in turn can provide a greater amount of certainty of time, cost and quality.</p>
    <p>The beneficial effects that 4D BIM enables in CM may include the ability to:</p>
        <li>win project tendering based on an organisation’s previous 4D BIM project success</li>
        <li>analyse previous 4D models for solutions to issues, which may be similar</li>
        <li>improve communication through better visualisation of the project plan</li>
        <li>visually identify clashes between alternative designs</li>
        <li>present an employer with alternative decision options</li>
        <li>determine site logistical solutions</li>
        <li>analyse visual representation of construction sequences</li>
        <li>improve schedule estimation</li>
        <li>reduce project schedule duration</li>
        <li>improve information quality assurances based on accuracy of project schedule</li>
    <br>
    <p>The ability of a CM team to manage risk and reduce risk variants throughout a projects lifecycle affords a project with a certain degree of assurance, against the probability of time delays (requests for information (RFI)’s) and subsequent cost increases. The opportunity to identify, assess and quantify risks at each stage of a project, this is made possible through a means of collaborative communication between project stakeholders and the visualisation of VC and 4D BIM technology.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Visual Comparison between Traditional and the 4D BIM approach in Construction Management</p>
    <br>
    <p>A combination of existing risk management practices, BIM and the evolution of 4D BIM technology is instrumental in reducing the negative risk probabilities involved with CM tasks, which increase safety assurances whilst maintaining organisational management to ensure consistent project productivity. The capability to provide stakeholders with visual recognition of actual construction progress compared to the project schedule presents equivocal evidence of risk mitigation. CM based on a successful business template incorporates a risk management framework into a 4D BIM project management strategy at design and subsequent planning stages. Involving the risk analysis of data, which is systematically collated according to the EIR. The use of information construction technology (ICT) and 4D BIM to provide the management team with detailed work in progress (WIP) data in real-time, which is analysed through collaboration techniques and dynamic information is derived. The management of sub-contractors in accordance with the CM process can be seen to be simplified through the manipulation of 4D BIM and the ability to link various work schedules with a specific planned construction area, which in-turn provides the ability for visualisation of building element clashes, through a virtual representation.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The ability of 4D BIM to show clashes before they happen at design stage means that alternative designs can be visualised and compared with the planned construction schedule. Clash detection is validated through collaboration and coordination of sub-contractor management teams, reducing the risk of a dis-jointed construction management process. Discrete-event-simulation (DES) allows the simulation of a specific task and a means of resource allocation is used efficiently and that productivity can be optimised to provide assurance that the project keeps to the schedule. Collaboration amongst multiple AEC disciplines to analyse a series of location based WBS’s within the project schedule and visualise DES through 4D BIM technology to provide the information necessary to detect location, element or resource clashes and allows for changes to be made accordingly. 4D BIM can be used as a means of capturing and visualising a project in real-time at any stage throughout construction, to enable regular checks of planned outputs against actual outputs based on pre-defined quality requirements to provide quality assurance. The addition of a WBS to the planned schedule, which is linked to the 4D BIM model can provide the CM team with a detailed framework of specific tasks associated to specific construction area’s that align resources i.e. operatives, materials and plant at any given time throughout construction. Regular collaboration meetings between sub-contractors and those of the CM team with the relevant knowledge to interpret collated data, which is analysed and the information that is procured, together with continuous coordinated visual monitoring and testing can establish if there are discrepancies between planned and actual productivity outputs for specific tasks.</p>
    <p>Quality management of a construction project begins at the planning stage, which sets out a scheduled number of quality assurance checks, where by a series of surveys are carried out throughout a 4D BIM project, enabling the quality control of quality issues. A quality management process when incorporated into a structured analytical means of capturing and recording changes to construction elements can enhance quality control through visualisation techniques. To increase productivity, quality control and a reduced number of RFI’s throughout the life cycle of a project collaboration at the planning stage is essential. Through the use of a common data environment (CDE) (an online destination, which is used to save, organise and share project data) as a requirement of the EIR, it is possible for project stakeholders to collaborate and exchange ideas.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 18pt; font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Exemplar Aspects of Evaluation</p>
    <p>An organisations information requirements (OIR) need to be established when deciding to implement (4D) BIM within an organisation, which is a decision with a number of elements of risk involved including the financial outlay for hardware, software and the 4D BIM training required of an organisation’s stakeholders involved within the supply chain. There is a lack of technical information available to organisations/end- users and a number of concerns are apparent, regarding the choices presented when choosing a 4D BIM software application. These include interoperability issues of each BIM software application file formats and the induced risk of data corruption and data validity, to facilitate collaboration across multiple disciplines from a 4D BIM perspective. It is essential for the safety of data transfer to coordinate workflows to achieve effective project productivity. Depending on a projects stakeholder knowledge of 4D BIM and the use of the software application to coordinate CM, the degree of ease of use is an important factor for project stakeholders to be involved within the projects collaborative environment, facilitated through 4D BIM technology. The effective use of a 4D BIM software application requires knowledge of the risk analysis capabilities and the manipulation of a federated 4D BIM model between multiple disciplines. Also the capability to visualise the virtual construction at any stage of the build to reduce risk to the time, cost and quality of a CM project. As well as to have an understanding of continuous updates to a project schedule, task process simulations, temporary structure logistics and/or clash detections between multiple-disciplines.</p>
    <p>Visualisation capabilities of the appropriate 4D BIM software application may be a valuable asset for an organisation, where it has the capability to show stakeholders a comparative analysis of planned value (PV) of a project against actual cost value (AC) according to cost estimations for a given point in the schedule to improve the efficiency and productivity of CM, throughout each stage of a 4D BIM project. An organisations reputation may be enhanced through public opinion, on their stance to address the urgency of global warming and contribute to carbon emission reductions, crucial to sustainability realised through the use of 4D BIM to minimize construction waste production and may be considered to be improving CM on a global scale, minimizing the carbon footprint of construction. The use of clash detection is of major importance when used to offset waste, through reduced design mistakes and a systematic approach to CM planning and efficient construction practices, which may provide quality assurances as a direct result of lean 4D BIM practices.</p>
