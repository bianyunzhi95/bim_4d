    <p>To evaluate the suitability of a 4D BIM software application for a CM project it is necessary to evaluate the various 4D BIM software applications that are available. A measurement of success achieved in a CM project may be ascertained by defining performance indicators (PI)’s of previous successful construction projects with similar objectives and requirements, based on a comparable set of project constraints. Key performance indicators (KPI')’s may be assessed from other organisations experiences, which may present parallels. The ability to measure and quantify a KPI may be assessed and evaluated according to a method of scoring the comparability between construction projects. When choosing a 4D BIM software application that is best suited for a construction project, several aspects must be considered and evaluated to facilitate the decision-making process. The purpose of this research is to aid in the ability for a decision to be taken using a structured approach with all the relevant and comparable information used to increase the reliability of decisions, which are based on similar decision criteria.</p>
    <p>An analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is a method of measurement, through pairwise comparisons and relies on the judgments of experts to derive priority scales. It is a systematic process of documenting justifiable evidence of means and methods to derive comparability, a decision maker must determine the question for, which a decision is required.</p>
    <p>This process of informed decision making involves several factors:</p>
    <li>several alternative solutions</li>
    <li>a scale of evaluation defining relevance of importance</li>
    <li>a method to evaluate consistency</li>
    <br>
    <p>It is possible to define the essential CM requirements of a project by establishing similarities in previous CM projects and deriving a set of fundamental requirements based on previous experience. The ability of a 4D BIM software application to enable efficient and successful CM may be attributed to the applications ability to manage a projects constraints, which are based on time, cost and quality (‘the iron triangle” of project management). The 4D BIM applications suitability to a specific project may be established by each of the 4D BIM attributes ability to manage a set of specific project constraints. Therefore there is a need for relevant 4D BIM software application analysis to determine its suitability for a specific CM project’s set of constraints. Due to a lack of comparable decision support, it is desirable to develop a multi-criteria decision support system for the selection of a 4D BIM software application.</p>

    <p>The question asked within the parameters of this analysis is to ascertain, which 4D BIM software application is effective in establishing a reliable and consistent decision making approach to a CM project. Also to determine a series of alternatives from, which to make a dependable decision through an analytical process of defining comparative choices. Successful decision making may be realised through the direction that is offered when using a DSS as a definitive aid to facilitate a structured process. This analytic process can be classified as a multi criteria decision method (MCDM) question, meaning that the success when choosing a suitable 4D BIM software application, can be influenced through the use of a structured DSS.</p>
    <p>The purpose of this analysis is to incorporate a DSS to aid in the decision making process, to determine, which 4D BIM software application is the most compatible with a project specific set of requirements. A computerised DSS program was developed using a series of python code functions to firstly establish the similarities or closeness between CM project based constraints and secondly to provide the ability to offer a score rating for each of a set of defined 4D BIM software application attributes, based on CM performance. The data collated will be stored in the DSS program’s data base and aims to provide dependable consistency. The ratings for the attributes are scored on their ability to offer an improved CM strategy, facilitated through a BIM philosophy. The data base will be developed and populated with relevant data input provided by 4D BIM professionals for a number of the 4D BIM software application attributes and the ability of each of these attributes to be considered as improving CM.</p>
    <p>The development of a best practice evaluation tool may provide recommendations taken from a dynamic archive. The answers found can be attributed to the opinions of multiple 4D BIM professionals and the knowledge offered through project experience of one of three 4D BIM technologies (navisworks, asta power project or synchro). The evaluation tool has the potential capacity to provide an organisation with the ability to optimise the decision process and improve risk management, when choosing a 4D BIM software application that best suits a projects requirements.</p>
    <p>The program is developed to be a focused DSS and an example of a fictional public-sector community construction project to offer a detailed method of explaining the measures used to define a set of CM project constraints are shown.</p>
